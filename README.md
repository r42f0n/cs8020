Overview
Artificial intelligence has great effect on modern lives. In this coursework, the theme on framework design of new medical image-based bias-mitigated and fair computer-aided diagnosis system will be investigated and explored. The coursework consists of two parts. In Part 1, you need to complete a report based given theme. In Part 2, you need to explain your design via video presentation.
Part 1 (Individual Report: 70 marks)
Healthcare industry is rich of electronic (digital) medical data from different modalities. Deep learning has revolutionized the use of machine learning in healthcare industry by leveraging on the model’s automatic feature extraction and learning. To date, deep models have been applied for numerous computer-aided diagnosis tasks such as prediction, detection and classification. Despite its promising outlook, deep learning- based computer-aided diagnosis models still fail to earn the trust of medical doctors. In fact, there are reports of inaccurate missed diagnoses due to bias error, lack of understanding about the underlying mechanism of deep learning, and miscalibration in real practice. Therefore, there is an open call for fair and transparent computer-aided diagnosis model for trustworthy smart healthcare.
The aim of this task is to empirically assess the current status of computer-aided diagnosis, technologies, challenges and solutions in smart healthcare, and research questions in AI fairness to design a towards innovative bias-mitigated and fair deep learning medical image-based computer-aided diagnosis model framework design with predefined traits. Hence, you are required to equip yourselves with the understanding about the specific domain of medical imaging. Besides, you need to apply the
  
knowledge acquired from the lectures and tutorials to complete this coursework. You also need to do literature review to identify further relevant information that is helpful to develop your report content.
Task Instructions:

Moreover, you are required to study extra learning materials to familiarize yourselves with image- based computer-aided diagnosis by using deep learning. Please note that no mark will be given to the literature review nor content extract from the given review paper. However, this effort shall serve as your first steep for your proposed towards innovative bias-mitigated and fair deep learning medical image-based computer-aided diagnosis model framework design.

cohort criterion.
    Framework Design
    You are required to propose and explained a new design framework based on the motivation, case study 1 and 2. The new design framework should be illustrated in a detailed overall model diagram. The design framework should encompass the following characteristics:
• Selection of most appropriate AI backbone models for maximum bias-mitigation compared to other state-of- art
• Use of relevant explainable AI for transparent algorithmic mechanism
• Use of relevant evaluation metrics to evaluate the AI fairness improvement
